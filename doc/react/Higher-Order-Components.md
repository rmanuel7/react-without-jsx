# [Higher-Order Components](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic.

> [!NOTE]
> HOCs are not part of the React API.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> They are a pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s compositional nature.

> [!TIP]
> A Higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
